DVM has now been installed in your shell's loading file.

1) You must now ensure that there is no 'return' from inside
the .bashrc or .bash_profile file, otherwise dvm may
be prevented from working properly.

This means that if you see something like:

'[ -z \"\$PS1\" ] && return'

then you change this line to:

if [[ -n \"\$PS1\" ]] ; then

# ... original content that was below the '&& return' line ...

fi # <= be sure to close the if at the end of the .bashrc.

# This loads DVM into a shell session.
if [[ -s "$HOME/.dvm/scripts/dvm" ]] ; then
	. "$HOME/.dvm/scripts/dvm"
fi

EOF - This marks the end of the .bashrc file

Be absolutely *sure* to REMOVE the '&& return'.

If you wish to DRY up your config you can 'source ~/.bashrc' at the bottom of your .bash_profile.

Placing all non-interactive (non login) items in the .bashrc,
including the 'source' line above and any environment settings.

2) CLOSE THIS SHELL and open a new one in order to use dvm.
