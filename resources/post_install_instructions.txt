You must now complete the installation by loading DVM in new shells.

1) Place the following line at the end of your shell's loading files
(.bashrc or .bash_profile for bash and .zshrc for zsh),
after all PATH/variable settings:

# This loads DVM into a shell session.
if [[ -s "$HOME/.dvm/scripts/dvm"]] ; then
	source "$HOME/.dvm/scripts/dvm" ;
fi

You only need to add this line the first time you install dvm.

2) Ensure that there is no 'return' from inside the ~/.bashrc file,
otherwise dvm may be prevented from working properly.

This means that if you see something like:

'[ -z \"\$PS1\" ] && return'

then you change this line to:

if [[ -n \"\$PS1\" ]] ; then

# ... original content that was below the '&& return' line ...

fi # <= be sure to close the if at the end of the .bashrc.

# This loads DVM into a shell session.
if [[ -s "$HOME/.dvm/scripts/dvm"]] ; then 
	source "$HOME/.dvm/scripts/dvm" ;
fi.

EOF - This marks the end of the .bashrc file

Be absolutely *sure* to REMOVE the '&& return'.

If you wish to DRY up your config you can 'source ~/.bashrc' at the bottom of your .bash_profile.

Placing all non-interactive (non login) items in the .bashrc,
including the 'source' line above and any environment settings.

3) CLOSE THIS SHELL and open a new one in order to use dvm.
